Description: This package allows you to simulate a two group experiment with
        a specified number of correlated featured, meant to represent an omics
        dataset. The package comes with functions to create a customized 
        correlation matrix with strong, medium, weak or no correlation as well
        as background correlation amongst all features. There are a few options
        available for analysis after data generation which can be found in the 
        ?analyze documentation. The probability of selecting features which are
        specified to have effects (effect size specified by user) is summarized
        and returned as part of a list when the single_scenario_simulation 
        function is run. Options to adjust the number of repetitions completed 
        by the simulation, alpha adjustment function (see ?set.alpha), and a
        function for run-time testing are are included.
